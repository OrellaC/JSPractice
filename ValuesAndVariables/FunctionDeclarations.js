// ===== Function Declaration vs. Expressions ====
// The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population
